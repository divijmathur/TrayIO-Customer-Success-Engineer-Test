# TrayIO-Customer-Success-Engineer-Test
This is a program that controls an imaginary robotic hoover (like a Roomba) through an equally imaginary room based on the following rules: 
room dimensions (as X and Y coordinates on a cartesian plane)
location of patches of dirt (that are marked as X and Y coordinates)
an initial hoover position (as X and Y coordinates)
Driving Instructions (in the form of cardinal directions)

# Utilizing the project
To use this program make sure that you have downloaded NodeJS (http://www.nodejs.org).
Clone this Roomba repository.
After that you can run the program using the following command:
node roombaInstructions.js
